# Flowchart

- Diagramtic representation of a solution to a given problem.
- Allows to break down a situation into smaller steps.
- Helps to explain a solution to different domains and maintaince of code.
  
## How to approach a problem?
  
```
Analyse the Problem 
        ⬇
Break down problem into
  smaller sub parts
        ⬇
Write down solution on paper 
 (in a structered manner)
        ⬇
Verify the solution 
        ⬇
Write down the code
```
